Ex 3:
a) p(XY) = p(X|Y)*p(Y) = 0.365*0.5 = 0.1825 = 18.25%
b) p(Y| 0X) = p(Y) - p(XY) = (50-18.25)% = 31.75%

Ex 5:
Call the 3 doors A, B, C, assuming we first pick A, we have: 
p(A,B,C) = p(A) + p(B) + p(C) = 1
p(A) = 1/3
p(B, C) = p(B) + p(C) = 1/3 + 1/3 = 2/3
Assuming the host opens B, we have:
p(B) = 0
p(C) = p(B, C) - p(B) = 2/3 - 0 = 2/3
